# Pre-work - *tips*

**tips** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Shakeel Daswani**

Time spent: **5-6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x but not functional] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] App has an icon. 
- [x] App has a launch screen.
- [x] App screen backgrounds have color.

## Notes

Creating a settings screen was not a problem, however the directions to apply the settings screen to the app were a little hard to follow.
It was a little hard to follow the steps I found online on how to make the keyboard appear on the start of the app. I didn't know how to make the UITextField the first responder.
